## Diablo II
This script is created to simplify the installation and launch of Diablo II.
Diablo 2 installed through ./play.it relies on WINE, as we have not found a
native engine providing a playable experience yet. It downloads necessary open
and proprietary files and automates the process of preparing the game for launch
on KoruX.

## Installation

- Before installation, make sure that your machine has internet access.

- Run the installation script:
```
$ ./install.sh
```

- Enjoy the game:
```
$ diablo-2
```

## Where are the game files stored?
```
~/Diablo II/
~/.wine/drive_c/users/$USER/My Documents/Diablo II/
```
